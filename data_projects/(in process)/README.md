## Project 1: Data Cleaning with SQL

- **Dataset**: 
- **Skills**: Filtering nulls, fixing schema errors, standardizing formats
- **Tools**: PostgreSQL
- **Reflection**:  
  Practiced cleaning operations such as using `COALESCE()`, removing duplicates, renaming fields, and transforming values. Learned how important it is to understand the context before cleaning.
