# Mapping the Precarity of Grassroots Cultural Spaces

- A critical data project exploring how informal cultural and activist spaces appear, disappear, and remain undocumented within urban datasets.

## Scope

Geography: Rotterdam vs Amsterdam?
Time: last 5 years
Definition: spaces that are DIY / non-commercial and cultural, activist, or community-driven

## Dataset

OpenStreetMap: “cultural”, “community”, “venue”
Municipal open data: permits, zoning, closures
Event listings (historical or scraped)
Self-curated list (your own knowledge + desk research)

## Analytical Position

- Data is not neutral
- Informal spaces are structurally underrepresented
- This project treats missing data as political signal

## Notes

- Thinking about geography:
  - Do not try to make this a perfectly symmetrical comparison. Bad goal: “Equal datasets, equal metrics, perfect comparison” <> Good goal: “Show how unequal data infrastructures reflect unequal cultural recognition”
  - Design the project around that inequality, not fight it.“Show how unequal data infrastructures reflect unequal cultural recognition
  - Amsterdam = documented, branded, funded, studied VS Rotterdam = fragmented, DIY, informal, often invisible
  - Situated Knowledge: my Rotterdam scene experience is not bias — it’s methodological context: “This project combines open data with situated, community-based knowledge.”
  - Data contrast strengthens the argument: If Amsterdam has “better data,” that itself becomes a finding:
  - Who gets legible to the city? Who doesn’t?
