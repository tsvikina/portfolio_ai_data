# Data Analysis Portfolio

Welcome! This portfolio showcases selected data analysis projects using SQL and Python to extract insights, visualize trends, and support data-driven decision-making. Queries were developed and tested using DBeaver, and executed within Jupyter Notebooks using the sqlite3 Python library for reproducibility and documentation. For data manipulation and visualization the libraries pandas, matplotlib and seaborn were used.
