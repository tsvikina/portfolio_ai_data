# Deep Sea Fish Classifier

Welcome! This is my first deep learning project using the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) library.

## What it does
This project trains a model to classify images of deep-sea fish species. You can test it yourself by uploading your own fish images.

## Tools used
- Python
- fastai
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub Pages

## Blog
This project is part of my learning journey in AI. Read the full post and see the model results [here](./fish_classifier.html).

## About me
I'm Teodora â€” transitioning from event and culture management to data and AI. I'm currently studying deep learning with fastai and building my portfolio.

## Try it yourself
If you're curious, you can upload your own fish image and see what the model predicts!
