# Deep Sea Fish Classifier

Welcome to my first deep learning project, built with the [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/) library and deployed on [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)!

## What It Does  
This app uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of **deep-sea fish species**. Just upload an image of a fish, and the model will try to identify its species.

## Try It Out  
  **Live Demo:** [Click here to test it on Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/)  
> Replace the link with your actual Hugging Face Spaces URL once deployed.

## Tools & Technologies  
- Python  
- [fastai](https://www.fast.ai/)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/) â€” for the web interface  
- [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) â€” for deployment  
- Git + GitHub â€” for version control
