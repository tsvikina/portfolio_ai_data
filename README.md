# Welcome to My AI & Data Projects

Hi, I'm Teodora! I'm transitioning into data and AI from a background in event and cultural management.

Here you'll find my learning projects, experiments, and blog posts as I study deep learning, data analysis, and more.

## Current Focus
- Deep Learning with [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/)
- Prompt Engineering (Bit Academy)
- Data & AI internships with impact

## Projects
- [Deep Sea Fish Classifier](./fish_classifier.html): My first fastai project â€” classify fish species using computer vision!

More coming soon...
