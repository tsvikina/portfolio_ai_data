# Welcome to My AI & Data Projects

Hello, I'm Teodora. Over the past two years, I've been transitioning from organizing alternative music and multidisciplinary events in DIY spaces to building a new path in data and technology.

I'm passionate about uncovering insights through data and exploring how machine learning and analytics can be applied in creative and meaningful ways.

This portfolio is a collection of my learning projects, experiments, and blog posts as I continue studying deep learning, data analysis, and related topics.

I'm currently seeking a junior data position or internship, preferably in the Rotterdam, The Netherlands region, but I'm also open to remote opportunities and shorter term collaborative projects.

I'm especially interested in working with organizations that promote social equality, empower underrepresented communities, celebrate difference and diversity, and support environmental sustainability.

## Current Focus

- Looking for junior data analist position with impact
- Deep Learning with [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/)
- New project: Mapping the Precarity of Grassroots Cultural Spaces (A critical data project exploring how informal cultural and activist spaces appear, disappear, and remain undocumented within urban datasets.)

## Projects

The project section is divided in two parts: data projects and deep learning projects:

**Data projects**:

- [Bit Bikes Inventory Analysis](data_projects/bit_bikes_analysis) – A time series analysis of Divvy bike trips (2020–2022) to forecast inventory needs for July 2023 and support smarter bikeshare operations.
- [Chinook Data Exploration with SQL and Jupyter Notebooks](data_projects/chinook_project) -  A multi-layered exploration of customer behavior, genre profitability, and artist performance in a digital music store using advanced SQL techniques and data visualizations.
- [HR Dashboard](.data_projects/powerbi_projects/HR_Analysis) - A Power BI dashboard tailored for the Human Resources department to monitor hiring quality, work anniversaries, and workforce trends.
- [Salary Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)](./data_projects/powerbi_projects/salary_analysis) - This Power BI dashboard explores salary data from individuals working in the IT sector. It provides interactive visuals and insights based on factors such as gender, company, years of experience, and job role.
- [Sales Analysis](./data_projects/powerbi_projects/sales_analysis) - An interactive sales dashboard built with Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into sales trends, item performance, store performance, and seasonal patterns based on historical sales data.
- [Interactive Map Of The Netherlands](./data_projects/powerbi_projects/interactive_map_Netherlands/) - This Power BI dashboard visualizes geographic data across Dutch provinces, focusing on population density and water coverage.
**Deep Learning projects**:
- [Deep Sea Fish Classifier](./fish_classifier.html): My first fastai project — classify fish species using computer vision!
More coming soon...

## Analytical Position

- Data is not neutral
- Informal spaces are structurally underrepresented
- My projects treat missing data as political signal
