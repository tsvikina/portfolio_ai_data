# Welcome to My AI & Data Projects

Hello, I'm Teodora. Over the past two years, I've been transitioning from organizing alternative music and multidisciplinary events in DIY spaces to building a new path in data and technology.

I'm passionate about uncovering insights through data and exploring how machine learning and analytics can be applied in creative and meaningful ways.

This portfolio is a collection of my learning projects, experiments, and blog posts as I continue studying deep learning, data analysis, and related topics.

I'm currently seeking a junior data position or internship, preferably in the Rotterdam, The Netherlands region, but I'm also open to remote opportunities and collaborative projects.

I'm especially interested in working with organizations that promote social equality, empower underrepresented communities, celebrate difference and diversity, and support environmental sustainability.

## Current Focus
- Deep Learning with [fastai](https://course.fast.ai/)
- Looking for Data & AI internships with impact

## Projects
The project section is divided in two parts: data projects and deep learning projects:
- Deep Learning projects: 
    - [Deep Sea Fish Classifier](./fish_classifier.html): My first fastai project — classify fish species using computer vision!
- Data projects:
    - [Bit Bikes Inventory Analysis](data_projects/bit_bikes_analysis) – A time series analysis of Divvy bike trips (2020–2022) to forecast inventory needs for July 2023 and support smarter bikeshare operations.
    - [Chinook Data Exploration with SQL and Jupyter Notebooks](data_projects/chinook_project) -  A multi-layered exploration of customer behavior, genre profitability, and artist performance in a digital music store using advanced SQL techniques and data visualizations.

More coming soon...
