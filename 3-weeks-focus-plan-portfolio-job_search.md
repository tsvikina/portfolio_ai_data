# 3-Week Focus Plan (Flagship Portfolio + Job Search)

**Time frame:** Weeks 1–3
**Study days:** 5 per week
**Daily time available:** ~4 hrs
**Primary goal:**
Publish a politically grounded flagship data project
Use it to support job applications

---

# DAILY BASELINE (FLEXIBLE)

* [ ] Flagship project work (2–2.5 hrs)
* [ ] Job search / networking (45 min)
* [ ] Targeted refresh (30–45 min, project-driven)

* **Flagship project:** 2–2.5 hrs
* **Job search / networking:** 45 min
* **Light refresh (stats / SQL / Anki):** 30–45 min
  → ONLY cards or topics relevant to the project

❌ No fixed “150 cards” rule
❌ No guilt if energy dips
We optimize for *consistency*, not discipline theater.

## WEEK 1 — Framing & Data Reality Check

### Targets

* [x] Project scope finalized (Rotterdam vs Amsterdam)
* [ ] Clear definition of “grassroots cultural space”
* [ ] At least 2 data sources identified per city
* [ ] Repo + README skeleton created
* [ ] ≥1 job application or meaningful networking action

### Portfolio Log (Week 1)

* Research question(process): Where does my question lies? Is it into the timespan of existence of such places, the reasons they dissapear, or more positive in the changes they create. Do I ask myself about subsidies (cuz on the DIY conference in Leiden they talked so much about subsidies), am Imore interested in the availability of data or in the city? I like the idea of mapping the appeareance, disapeareance and the documentation/lack of documentation. I think this could be visualized beautifully, yet I on't know how. Would it be fun to compare the existence of such places with the quality of the soil and visualize that. Why it sounds more like an art project, I think it could beautifully visualize what I want to prove. Place summarize and clear my process of thinking.
* Main Axis: Visibility over time (appearance, disappearance, and lack of documentation). Who gets documented, who disappears quietly, and how cities remember (or erase) grassroots spaces.
* Research question: How do grassroots cultural and activist spaces appear, disappear, and remain undocumented over time in Amsterdam and Rotterdam — and what does this reveal about visibility, power, and urban recognition?
* Cities chosen & why: Amsterdam and Rotterdam
* What data exists: Decide the exact data sources (realistic list)
* What data is missing (important): ???
* Define what counts as “documented” vs “undocumented” (operational definitions)
* Sketch the repo structure + README outline
* Other Notes:

  * “Spaces receiving structural funding are more likely to appear in official datasets.”
  * IF I decide to compare with soil: “This layer is not used to explain cultural precarity, but to visually contrast organic, invisible systems with documented urban infrastructures.”
  * Visualization:
    * A. Timeline maps (Each space as a line across time | Gaps = invisibility | End points = closure or disappearance) are powerful, readable, political.
    * B. Visibility layer (Same map, multiple layers: Official datasets | Community knowledge | Event listings)“What appears where — and what never appears officially?”
    * C. Negative space visualization (Explicitly visualize: areas with cultural activity vs areas with documented activity) - Absence becomes visible.

## WEEK 2 — Data Collection & Exploration

### Targets

* [ ] Data collected (even if messy / incomplete)
* [ ] Initial cleaning & exploration
* [ ] First spatial or temporal visualizations
* [ ] Limitations documented clearly
* [ ] ≥3–5 job applications or targeted messages

### Portfolio Log (Week 2)

* Data sources used:
* Biggest gaps / exclusions noticed:
* First emerging patterns:

## WEEK 3 — Analysis, Narrative & Publication

### Targets

* [ ] Core analysis complete
* [ ] At least one comparative insight (Rotterdam vs Amsterdam)
* [ ] README written with political/critical framing
* [ ] Repo cleaned & presentable
* [ ] ≥3–5 applications or follow-ups

### Portfolio Log (Week 3)

* Key findings:
* What this says about power / visibility:
* What you would expand with more time:

## 3-Week Review

* What gave energy?
* What drained energy?
* One system rule to keep:
* One rule to delete forever:

## 8️⃣ Next step (small, concrete)

Before we touch the README or data:

**Answer just this:**

> Which type of spaces are *definitely in scope* for you?
> (e.g. DIY venues, squats, community centers, temporary spaces, activist hubs)

List 3–5 types.
That will let us define the dataset and avoid scope creep.

You’re doing this thoughtfully and honestly — that’s exactly how meaningful portfolios are built.
